# TicTacToe
    This Tic Tac Toe game is currently under development as a software engineering
    course assignment.
    The primary focus of this task is to demonstrate proficiency in version control 
    tools, such as git and github. Therefore, the complexity of this project was not
    an interest point itself, as the scope of the assignment revolves towardsmy ca-
    pability to better utilize, manage and organize the code whithin these tools.
