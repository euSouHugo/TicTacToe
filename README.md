# TicTacToe
    This Tic Tac Toe game made as a software engineering course assignment.
    In this task, I was to prove my skills in version control tools, such as git and or github; therefore, 
    the complexity of the this project was not an interest point itself, as the scope of the assignment 
    revolves towards my capability to better utilize, manage and organize the code in said tools.
